## Instructions

### Copy the directory `data/graphhopper` in the `Downloads` directory of the phone to make the maps work.

### The behaviour of the maps without these errors is not known right now. It could be an error or just fail silently. Will update this later

Resulting path -
> /Download(s)/graphhopper/maps/ireland-and-northern-ireland-latest-gh


The -gh directory will then contain the following files -

1. edges
1. geometry
1. ireland-and-northern-ireland-latest.map
1. location_index
1. nodes
1. nodes_ch_car
1. nodes_ch_fastest_car_node
1. properties
1. shortcuts_car
1. shortcuts_fastest_car_node
1. string_index_keys
1. string_index_vals
